## Network Model Reproduces Personalized Brain Dynamics in Autism Spectrum Disorder

This repository contains the codes that I've written and used for my thesis work 'Network Model Reproduces Personalized Brain Dynamics in Autism Spectrum Disorder'. 
The overall pipeline includes integrating different methods for analyzing EEG data and structural connectivity data and the simulation and optimization process of the personalized brain network model.

## Contents

-  pipeline of multimodal analysis for EEG data (h.>i.)
        
-  pipeline of structural connectivity analysis (b.>l.)

-  pipeline of simulation of the brain network model in the virtual brain framework (b.>c.>d.>e.)

-  pipeline of optimization process and feature importance (h.>g.<>f.<e.)

  The codes were written in Python integrating the Virtual Brain Framework and several libraries in a unified frame.
  The EEG and MRI datasets of the two subjects used in this study have been acquired at the IRCCS Stella Maris Foundation under the clinical supervision of Dr. E. Bartolini and Dr. S. Calderoni, and shared, after anonymization, for research purposes within a scientific collaboration between the Santâ€™Anna School of Advanced Studies and the Stella Maris Institute.
  I preprocessed the EEG data with standard techniques with the EEGLAB toolbox, and the codes in this repository assume preprocessed EEG data in input.

## Known issues (work in progress)
This repository is still ongoing. The material is going to be integrated in a global framework for a coming publication, including the MRI tractography pipeline (a.>b.), developed by Michelangelo Fabrizzi.
